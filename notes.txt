What is typescript ?
Static Typed, Superset of Js to provide efficient debugging.
adds helpful and productive features over js
originally developed to handle large projects but cann handle smaller ones too.
It also refers to the compiler which trans-compiles code written in ts syntax to js which is widely supported accross all browsers

Types of Js features :
1. widely suppported : adopted by all browsers
2. es current : specified in the docs but still not adopted by all browsers
3. es future : to be added in future to js
With ts using all these features is possible along with other features in modern browsers
the ts transpiler converts strong , static typed ts to plain js which any browser can understand

advantages of js:
1.catch errors at compile time instead of run time 
2.better tooling support (refactoring, autocomplete and so on)
3.explicitly express intent


Start:
1. install nodejs and then install typescript globally using npm
2. in the root directory of your project file add the tsconfig.json file
